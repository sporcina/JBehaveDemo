Narrative: Customer withdraws cash
As a customer,
I want to withdraw cash from an ATM,
so that I donâ€™t have to wait in line at the bank.


Scenario: Account is in credit
Given account 111-111-1110 is in credit
And the card is valid
And the dispenser contains cash
When the customer requests cash
Then ensure the account is debited
And ensure cash is dispensed
And ensure the card is returned
